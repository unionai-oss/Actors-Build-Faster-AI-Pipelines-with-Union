# Build Faster AI Pipelines with Union Actors

Actors in Union let you reuse a container and its environment across multiple tasks, skipping the costly overhead of starting a fresh container every time. This is a Union-only feature that isnâ€™t available in open-source Flyte.

Run the tutorial in colab or setup to run locally.
